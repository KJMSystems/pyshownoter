How were you thinking of structuring it?

I was just thinking of the links and data that get posted during the conversation get processed and spat back out

in markdown


kjaymiller

[9:02 AM]
then we store the file in slack


kjaymiller

[9:02 AM]
I was just trying to come up with an easy way to manage that


jamal

[

Ok.  Last time I noticed that the messenger and slack chats were separate


kjaymiller

[
9:03 AM

right which is why I had to upload the notes into the slack chate


kjaymiller

[9:03 AM]
chat*… which is fine.


jamal

[
9:03 AM

And you are right it does sound like we are talking about different things :)


jamal

[9:04 AM]
I haven't looked, but I assume that slack has an API?


kjaymiller

[
9:04 AM
]
yeah but it’s just easier to upload the file


kjaymiller

[9:05 AM]
testing sorry


jamal

[

Np


jamal

[9:06 AM]
How about scraping the data.  You mentioned bs4. is that a better option than RSS or the slack API?


kjaymiller

[

beautiful soup is just an easy way to grab the page title


kjaymiller

[9:07 AM]
before I have to take the link and come up with a title for it


kjaymiller

[9:07 AM]
with bs4 I can just have python fetch the title for me


jamal

[
9:08 AM

Ok, I think I understand now


jamal

[9:08 AM]
How do you know how far to go back?


kjaymiller

[
9:08 AM

I just copy the entire chat string and let python take everything out


kjaymiller

[9:09 AM]
There will be a little organization needed but nothing too crazy.


kjaymiller

[9:09 AM]
I wonder if there could be a little “pt syntax” we could use


kjaymiller

[9:10 AM]
Like >https://google.com  #potato


kjaymiller

[9:10 AM]
the “>” will state it’s a link


kjaymiller

[9:10 AM]
wait….


kjaymiller

[9:10 AM]

> https://google.com #help


kjaymiller

[9:10 AM]
the “>” is link followed by the url


kjaymiller

[9:11 AM]
then the “#” tells us a category


jamal

[
9:11 AM
]
That's cool.


kjaymiller

[
9:11 AM
]
then python will take out everything else


kjaymiller

[9:12 AM]
read the # and create a lists based on all the links under that “#"


jamal

[

You could build on it too...  add notes or something


kjaymiller

[
9:12 AM
]
exactly


kjaymiller

[9:13 AM]
did you look at the existing code I put up on git


jamal

[
9:14 AM
]
I havent.  When did you put it up there?


kjaymiller

[
9:14 AM
]
that night
