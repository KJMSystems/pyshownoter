I didn't really understand that one

jvcode [1:29 PM] 
Neither did I

jvcode [1:29 PM]
But last night I was working on code that could be used for issue #11 if the text file is set up like that

jamal [1:43 PM] 
Maybe use yaml or json to define room sizes and contents?

kennethlove [1:44 PM] 
wouldn’t each room be an instance of a Room class and have attributes that define the exits, size, and contents?

jamal [1:44 PM] 
@kennethlove I want to run all unit or all functional but not both because I should have failing functional tests when I code my unit tests

jvcode [1:45 PM] 
@jamal: That could work

jvcode [1:47 PM]
@kennethlove: I originally thought it would be an instance of a Room class in which case there would be no need for a text file of any kind because each room can be created using the Room class

jamal [1:48 PM] 
I think a room class makes sense

jvcode [1:50 PM] 
Yeah because then you would have functions that do what @kennethlove just mentioned.

kennethlove [1:51 PM] 
classes have methods :wink: modules have functions.

jvcode [1:51 PM] 
:speak_no_evil:

jvcode [1:51 PM]
:stuck_out_tongue:

jvcode [1:51 PM]

kennethlove [1:51 PM] 
lol it doesn’t matter

kennethlove [1:51 PM]
everyone will know what you mean

jvcode [1:52 PM] 
Lol, yeah, but it is better to know the proper way.

jamal [2:13 PM] 
being new to python I get libraries and modules mixed up

kennethlove [2:14 PM] 
they’re effectively the same thing, @jamal

jamal [3:23 PM] 
lol, true.  but like methods and functions

kennethlove [3:29 PM] 
i mean libraries and modules

jamal [5:19 PM]
Trying a different laptop today to hopefully fix the mic issue

jvcode [5:20 PM] 
Hopefully. If it doesn't work then I think your mic is doing it on purpose

jamal [5:21 PM] 
my mic works at all other times, but none of those are with that laptop so I am thinking it is the guilty party

jamal [5:22 PM]
I think Phillip is out today

jvcode [5:24 PM] 
I think so too.

jamal [5:24 PM] 
if my mic works and people are up for it, I can go over stuff I have done with the text adventure and answer questions about getting started with it

I also left a comment on issue #10 about just using `class Room():` instead of pulling data from a file. (edited)

jamal [8:52 PM] 
I think we could do both, but will let you run with what you think is the best implementation

jamal [8:53 PM]
I am sure you will find a great solution

jvcode [8:56 PM] 
We could definitely do both. I will see which one is more effective. I know I wrote some code that pulls from a text file and creates a dictionary with the room as key and size as value, but I think if we use a file, maybe it should be what you mentioned the other day, YAML or JSON or CSV. I feel they are possibly better suited for the job.

jamal [9:01 PM] 
I was thinking that the room class would load the config data for the specific room from a file, but at this point making a Room class is more important than how each room is setup.

jamal [9:02 PM]

For anyone who is a bit wary of obeying the testing goat and would like a reference a text other than TDD with python (http://obeythetestinggoat.com); there is chapter 9 of Dive into Python 3 that introduces unit testing in Python http://www.diveintopython3.net/unit-testing.html

jvcode [7:35 AM] 
I don't know how to write a test for the room class I was working on. You kind of just pass it the .csv file and then call each method so that you create the rooms.

jamal [7:38 AM] 
You could write a test that passes it a known set of values and assert that Room () behaves in an expected way based on the .csv

jamal [7:44 AM] 
Maybe this is as simple as loading a room map and then asking the Room () what exists at certain coordinates.   if it is what you expect,  the test passes

jamal [7:46 AM]
If you are simply testing the csv, you could test that certain information. you will want is available in the .csv

jvcode [7:51 AM] 
Okay that makes sense.

jamal [8:00 AM] 
if it is only the .csv that is being committed, I wouldn't worry too much about tests as they should test code

jvcode [8:05 AM] 
Yeah. The code I wrote is completely dependent on the .csv file so I know it will work.
