# python-thursday
This is the package for compiling all of the links into the thursday show notes

#### Requirements:
* python (2.7/3.4) 
* text document

#### Document needs:
All items without links will need to have at least 1 "#" at the begininng.
Please format the links with "description-url"

#### What it does:
pt-shownoter reformats the document into the following format

#heading
* \[description\]\(url\)

This is the standard [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format. 

#### Future plans 
I plan to create a bot that aggregatest the note and then returns them.
