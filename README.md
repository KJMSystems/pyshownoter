This is a link 

> "link.com"

THis link is really cool.... 

> "Yeah"

You mention this link on your podcast...
> "blah blah  'link.com' blah blah"

You should put that link in your shownotes.

But then you need to format it.... 
You search for google and then you find it. Of course your you need to format it. But you also have to go to find the other 15 links you mentions. 

That seems like a lot. 

Then you have to format and structure your podcast.
