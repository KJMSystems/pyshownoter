# Shownoter
Organize and format your references into markdown with ease.

## *Shownoter wants to help you*

Shownoter is designed to take plain text and give you a formatted list of links and images. This will format your references that will help you prepare those shownotes.

## How does it work?

Sometimes important information is buried in random text.  A good example of this is a chat history for your hangout or podcast.

Take for instance the following example:

```
Jay: I have been really interested in playing battleship online.
Jamal: Yeah battleship is the best, I found this great game at LessThanTwoPlayerBattleship.com
Jay: That is great, I will check it out
Jay: BTW, I found this great site for helping boost productivity GoTeamTypingCatGo.net
Jamal: Thanks man, I am really excited about checking that out.

```

Afterward you want to add these links to your shownotes, but there has to be an easier way than sifting through all of the chat.

Once you find the links you will want to format them and give the links an appropriate name.

This is a lot of tedious work, but Shownoter will do it for you.

Shownoter will take the chat above and output a formatted list with descriptions like the following.

* [The home of 1.7 player battleship](LessThanTwoPlayerBattleship.com)
* [Go! Team typing cat Go! Homepage](GoTeamTypingCatGo.net)
